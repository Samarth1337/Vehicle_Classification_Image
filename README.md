# Vehicle_Classification_Image
Multilayer Perceptron built using Keras for the classification of emergency and non-emergency vehicles using Image data. Also applied transfer learning on the same (VGG16) in 2 different ways :
a) Using pretrained architecture but retraining on the dataset
b) Freezing initial layers (not changing weights) 

Implemented the same using PyTorch framework.
